> A real-time layout tool intended to provides pure css solution to frontend layout needs.

This project is still at its very infant stage - lots of interesting functionalies need to be further developed.

But it will, hopefully, showcase my coding ability as a fullstack developer and procure an internship for me :)

* Drag the generated components to the upper layout port
